Infrastructure for opening up data silos as linked data services (LIDS).

The project source is divided in several directories:
  * openlids.org: contents of the openlids homepage, including vocabulary definition
  * lids-infrastructure: library for general handling of LIDS descriptions, automatic interface generation, and automatic interlinking (annotating RDF data with links to LIDS)
  * lids: source code for sample LIDS

The code relies on the following libraries (included in the repository):
  * [Jena](http://openjena.org/), [ARQ](http://openjena.org/ARQ)
  * [NxParser](http://sw.deri.org/2006/08/nxparser/)
